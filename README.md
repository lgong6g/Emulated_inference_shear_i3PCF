# Emulated_inference_shear_i3PCF
Codes that used in producing all results in the paper of emulation based inference of shear integrated 3PCF

The code includes three major parts:
1. The emulation of shear i3PCF and other cosmological background quantities using NN and GP
2. The measurement of data vectors from
